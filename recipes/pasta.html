    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Our White Sauce Pasta recipe is one that is so simple and loved so much that it’s made at least once a month. In fact, it’s so easy that the older kids can make it on their own. We love to serve it with some Fried Zucchini and Cheesy Garlic Bread (or Knots) and especially love that it’s made in no time. It’s honestly too good not to love.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>penne – or another short pasta like macaroni or rotini</li>
        <li>unsalted butter</li>
        <li>minced garlic</li>
        <li>flour – Make a gluten-free substitute using four parts potato starch to three parts cornflour. Once you have the mixture, measure out 3 tablespoons and use it in place of the flour.</li>
        <li>milk – Use whole milk for the creamiest pasta sauce, but you can also use 2% or fat free milk. If you want it extra thick, use half and half or heavy cream.</li>
        <li>chicken broth – or vegetable broth for a vegetarian version</li>
        <li>mozzarella & parmesan cheese – To make the cheese sauce extra cheesy, add up to ½ cup more of each. </li>
        <li>season with parsley, garlic salt & black pepper – You can also add a teaspoon of red chili flakes or nutmeg.</li>
    </ul>
